2d-game-engine
================

Individual study project I worked on for school.  I worked through tutorials that basically broke down and explained Notch�s 2D engine he created for his Ludum Dare entry [Minicraft](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=398).  The assets I created are free to use.
